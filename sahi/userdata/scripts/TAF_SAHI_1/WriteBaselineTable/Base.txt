We believe strongly in open-source technology and the power of the open-source

community to develop applications with shared benefits. We specialize in an open-source

technology stack: Linux, Apache, Postgres, Mysql, PHP, and Ruby on Rails. We believe

that many of the modern web application development frameworks have the dual benefit

of hastening application development and consequently improving your ROI-- but also

of saving you money down the stretch by building in design patterns, such as MVC, that

encourage DRY development and decoupled encapsulation. Therefore, we recommend

Ruby on Rails as our first choice when developing new web applications for its speed

of delivery, great unit testing framework, deployment tools, ORM layer, and clean MVC

implementation. We have experience with a number of other web application frameworks,

such as CakePHP, Django, and Zend. Mobile apps are no longer an optional product

strategy for our customers. From mobile-optimized web sites to native iOS and Android

applications, we extend our customers' reach to mobile devices.
